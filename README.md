# Git-Ignore-Redemption
made a mistake and had no git ignore in your project? do this and easly fix

 cd /d/Projects/Git/My\ Git/Magical-Vending-Machine

git rm -r --cached .
git add .
git commit -m "Drop files from .gitignore"

make a github about what to do when you fuck up and forget to add the needed gitignore with my experience.
